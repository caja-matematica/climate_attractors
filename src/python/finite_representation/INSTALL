Installation instructions for building and installing RADS (Rigorous
Analysis of Dynamical Systems) on Linux and Mac.

Requirements:

* Python

Python2.7 (not Python3.*) and Cython. The best option
for Mac is to download and install Enthought (there is a free kitchen
sink academic version). On Linux, make sure that python-dev and cython-dev, etc have been installed for the necessary include files. 

* CAPD

An interval arithmetic library is needed to build RADS. The version we
use is CAPD, found here: http://capd.ii.uj.edu.pl/. Download and build/install. This might take a few minutes. Also, the homology library (RedHom) is not needed, so grab the smaller package if possible.


To build:

1. Edit a suitable config_*.py file for your system (copy config_*.py to config_*.py.bak first!)
2. Edit entries of config_*.py to match your system. (config_MAC.py has a few comments that apply to both systems)
3. Run makeit or makeit_MAC in the base directory
4. Compiled files should now appear in build/lib

Good Luck!!
